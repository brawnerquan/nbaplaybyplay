Abstract:
Many Machine Learning techniques have been used to attempt to predict the outcome of NBA games. Before the Deep Learning Revolution, previous research has investigated classic machine learning methods such as regression models, SVM, and various simple Feed Forward Neural Networks in search of improving the state of the art in predicting the outcome of NBA games. Taking inspiration from Football Match Prediction using Deep Learning, we explore a LSTM based approach to predict the outcome of NBA games and achieve an 79.59% accuracy in predicting the outcome of NBA games.
